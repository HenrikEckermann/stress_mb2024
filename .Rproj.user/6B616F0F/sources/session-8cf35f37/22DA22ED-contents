We investigated whether we could detect changes in the maternal microbiota from the second to the third trimester and whether the maternal microbiota at eight months postpartum differed from the prenatal microbiota. Furthermore, we examined how prenatal and postnatal maternal stress were related to the maternal and infant microbiota. We hypothesized that prenatal stress would be positively associated to maternal microbiota volatility and that pre- and postnatal maternal stress would be negatively related with the abundance of *Bifidobacterium* and positively associated with the abundance of *Proteobacteria* and with infant microbiota volatility in early life. In the following we will summarize and discuss the results.

### 1) Maternal microbiota during and after pregnancy

Our data supports previous findings indicating that the maternal microbiota does not undergo major changes between the second and the third trimester [@digiulioTemporalSpatialVariation2015a;@yangSystematicAnalysisGut2020]. However, we did observe changes from pregnancy to eight months postpartum. Specifically, we detected a significant decrease in Faith alpha diversity at eight months postpartum as compared to the first and the second trimester. While we also observed that beta diversity was significantly different at eight months postpartum compared to the second trimester of pregnancy, the effect size of this finding does not warrant interpreting it as a major change. Nevertheless, the decrease in Faith alpha diversity as well as observed decreases in, for example,  *Akkermansia muciniphila*, *Anaerostipes hadrus*, *Streptococcus thermophilus* and *Streptococcus salivarius* as well as increases in, for example, *Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans*, *Ruminococcaceae* and *Clostridiales bacterium* indicate that the microbiota postpartum differs significantly from the prenatal microbiota. The observed changes could be due to physiological changes induced by shifting from the pregnant to the non-pregnant state and to the induction of breastfeeding but could also be due to lifestyle changes related to the postpartum period, which is characterized by alterations in sleep, activity, diet, and other behavioral changes. While we collected prenatal data on lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and sleep, we did not collect these variables at eight months postpartum, limiting our analysis in that regard. To further study the potential changes induced by pregnancy or the shift into the non-pregnant state, it would be interesting to include more follow up samples as well as samples from before conception and to collect data about lifestyle changes associated with the pregnancy and postpartum period. Moreover, we observed that pre-pregnancy body mass index (pBMI) was associated with microbiota composition in multiparous but not primiparous women across time. This is in contrast with previous research that found an association between pBMI and changes in the gut microbiota throughout pregnancy only in primiparous women [@kennedyParityModulatesImpact2022]. However, our data and analyses are not comparable to those of the previous study as they collected samples also in the first trimester and included gestational weight gain in their statistical models. The potential interaction between parity and pBMI in relation to gut microbiota trajectories in the perinatal period warrants further research.

### 2) Maternal prenatal and postnatal stress and the maternal microbiota

We found limited evidence for an association between MS and alpha diversity. Namely, when comparing the low MS group with the medium or high MS group we found that only at eight months postpartum mothers reporting low levels of stress had slightly lower Shannon diversity than mothers reporting medium or high levels of stress. Interestingly, we did find that the PRAQR2-B (fear of giving birth) measured at 18 weeks pregnancy was negatively associated with alpha diversity at 18 weeks of pregnancy with both Shannon and Faith diversity. Similar results were observed at 32 weeks of pregnancy and therefore this association appeared to be more robust compared to the findings related to MS. The fact that we find different associations for MS and PRAQR2-B can be explained because of the limited overlap between those variables (supplementary figures S2-S3) and the different time points the microbiota samples were obtained. Indeed, the PRAQR2-B (fear of giving birth) subscale assesses very specific prenatal anxieties whereas the MS assesses stress in general. Furthermore, we detected two associations between measures of maternal stress with individual microbial species. First, we found a positive association between the PSS-10 and *Blautia* throughout all time points. Second, we found a negative association between hair cortisone (HCN3) and *Bacteroides cellulosilyticus* at 32 weeks of pregnancy. Lastly, we could not reject our null hypothesis that maternal stress is not related to maternal microbiota volatility. Possible explanations include that there is indeed no association between maternal stress and microbiota volatility during pregnancy. Alternatively, it is possible that the stress experienced in our sample of highly educated women, was not severe enough to induce significant changes in the more stable adult maternal microbiota. It is also possible that increased volatility could be observed at earlier stages of pregnancy such as from the first to the second trimester. Altogether these findings provide evidence that maternal stress, specifically fear of giving birth, is associated with the the maternal gut microbiota at different time points in the perinatal period.


### 3) Maternal prenatal and postnatal stress and the infant microbiota

Depending on the type of stress measurement and the time of maternal stress and infant microbiota sampling, we found contrasting associations between maternal stress and features of the infant gut microbiota. For example, we found negative associations between the STAI measured at 18 weeks of pregnancy as well as the PRAQR2-H (fear of a handicapped child) measured at 32 weeks of pregnancy and infant Shannon diversity at two weeks postpartum. Also, hair cortisone (HCN1) and MS at eight months postpartum were negatively related to alpha diversity at eight months postpartum. In line with this, the log-ratio of hair cortisol and cortisone (HCR2) was positively related to infant Shannon diversity at eight months postpartum. In contrast, the EPDS measured at 32 weeks and the PRAQR2-B (fear of giving birth) measured at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy were positively related to Shannon diversity at six and 12 weeks postpartum, respectively. While these findings provide strong evidence that prenatal maternal stress is related to infant microbiota alpha diversity, they also show that the association is not uniform across time or between different measures of stress. This is in line with Rojas et al. [@rojasLongtermTrimesterspecificEffects2023] and van den Bergh et al. [@vandenberghPrenatalDevelopmentalOrigins2020], who reported measurement- and trimester-specific associations between prenatal stress and the infant gut microbiota or other outcome measures, respectively. Our data indicate that, in addition, the potential effect of maternal stress also differs depending on time of measurement of the infant gut microbiota. We will touch upon a possible explanation when discussing our findings on volatility further below.

Next to the associations with alpha diversity, we found that the PRAQR2-B (fear of giving birth), hair cortisol (HCS3) and hair cortisone (HCN3) were related to infant beta diversity at different time points. We also identified many individual species related to our stress measurements across time and at the individual time points (supplementary Tables S8-S10). Most notably, we found a positive association between infant *Bacteroides fragilis* and maternal hair cortisol in the second and third trimester (HCS2 and HCS3) that was present across time and at the individual time points. *Bacteroides fragilis* has been associated with reduced levels of aggressive behavior, emotional reactivity, externalizing behavior, sadness, and impulsivity as well as an increase in inhibitory control and lower reported incidents of family turmoil [@flanneryGutFeelingsBegin2020]. Next to that it was associated with lower reported incidents of family turmoil [@flanneryGutFeelingsBegin2020]. Also, animal studies found that *Bacteroides fragilis* has protective effects against pathogen-induced gut inflammation and an autism-spectrum-disorder phenotype induced by maternal immune activation [@hsiaoMicrobiotaModulateBehavioral2013]. This means that our results are either in contrast with previous findings or, possibly, that the association between stress and *Bacteroides fragilis* is not linear, such that, e.g., while moderate levels of stress may be positively associated with it, more extreme levels of stress may lead to a relative decrease of this bacterium.  Furthermore, we found a negative association between *Flavonifractor plautii* at week six and maternal stress as measured by hair cortisol in the third trimester (HCS3). *Flavonifractor plautii* has been negatively associated with the development of asthma later in life [@stokholmMaturationGutMicrobiome2018a] and was able to strongly suppress Th2 immune responses in mice [@ogitaOralAdministrationFlavonifractor2020]. Furthermore, in line with our findings, *Flavonifractor plautii* has  been previously reported to be negatively associated with a maternal stress composite score at six weeks postpartum [@duttonMaternalPsychosocialStress2023] (which was based on STAI, EPDS, PSS and scales assessing several types of trauma and PTSD). We also reported previously that *Flavonifractor* was increased in a group of infants that received a destressing skin-to-skin contact intervention in the first five weeks of their lives [@eckermannDailySkintoskinContact2024]. Thus, our findings are in line with the literature and suggest that maternal physiological stress is related to a relative decrease in infant *Flavonifractor* at around six weeks postpartum. Lastly, in contrast to previous literature [@mephamExploringEffectPrenatal2023;@duttonMaternalPsychosocialStress2023;@zijlmansMaternalPrenatalStress2015;@galleyMaternalAnxietyDepression2023;@jahnkeMaternalPrecarityHPA2021], we did not find evidence for a positive association between prenatal stress and Proteobacteria or for a negative association with *Bifidobacteroium*.

Given the complexity of the microbial ecosystem and its diversity between different geographic regions and cultures, it may be challenging to find uniform associations between maternal stress with many of the microbiota features such as alpha diversity and relative abundances. However, in line with our hypothesis, we found that postnatal MS, PSS-10, and the log-ratio of hair cortisol and cortisone (HCR2) were associated with microbiota volatility between week two and six, week six and 12 and week 12 and eight months, respectively. With this study and previous studies, more research is accumulating that infant microbiota volatility is positively related to maternal stress. Namely, volatility has been reported to be increased in humans reporting higher levels of stress during exam periods, experimentally stressed mice, patients with inflammatory bowel disease and decreased in infants who received a destressing intervention in the first five weeks of their life [@bastiaanssenVolatilityConceptUnderstand2021;@clooneyRankingMicrobiomeVariance2021;@eckermannDailySkintoskinContact2024]. In addition, a similar metric indicated higher volatility (lower stability) over nine samples taken in the first 100 days of life in infants with colic [@deweerthIntestinalMicrobiotaInfants2013]. Furthermore, in line with our previous study of another group of Dutch infants [@eckermannDailySkintoskinContact2024], we found again that gestational age was negatively related to microbiota volatility, especially with volatility between week six and week 12 postpartum. 

There are many potential mechanisms through which maternal stress could induce volatility in the infant gut microbiota. For example, maternal stress may induce physiological changes in the mother that ultimately lead to a different composition and quality of breastmilk or changes in breastfeeding frequency and overall duration. We included feeding mode into the volatility models and found that between two and six weeks postpartum, mixed feeding was negatively associated with volatility compared to exclusive breastfeeding, whereas exclusively formula fed infants tended to have highest volatility in that period. However, between week six and 12 as well as between week 12 and eight months postpartum, exclusively breastfed infants had significantly lower microbiota volatility than mixed or fomula fed infants. This could be explained by the fact that as the diversity in diet increases (from exclusively breastfeeding to the introduction of increasingly complex solid food), the microbiota changes drastically initially. 


It will be interesting to see if future studies on maternal stress and the infant microbiota can consistently identify an association between stress and volatility. Then, the question remains whether volatility is a direct consequence of stress or whether people with higher microbiota volatility are more susceptible to experiencing stress. A study that tracks a few individuals with daily high frequency sampling of stress (e.g., with ecological momentary sampling) and the gut microbiota may be able to provide evidence about the timeline of this association. But the question would remain whether volatility has any negative or positive effects on health by itself or whether what causes volatility simultaneously causes alternations in health.

### Strengths and limitations

Strengths include the many microbiota sampling time points of both mothers during pregnancy and at eight months postpartum and infants in the first year of life. These allowed us to evaluate our research questions on microbiota volatility. Also, our microbiota samples, in conjunction with measurements of maternal stress via reported stress as well as objectively measured stress (hair cortisol/cortisone), provided data covering many time points sampled individually in previous studies researching the association between maternal stress and the maternal and infant gut microbiota. This, and analyzing questionnaires that measure perinatal specific and general stress, helped to shed light on the consistency and reproducibility of findings across studies. To analyze our microbiota samples, we used shotgun metagenomic sequencing, allowing us to work with higher taxonomic resolutions compared to previous studies. Limitations include that we did not measure potentially relevant covariates at eight months postpartum such as physical activity, sleep, and diet. This limited our analyses on factors contributing to the changes in the maternal microbiota from 32 weeks of pregnancy to eight months postpartum. Also, we studied a healthy, highly educated sample in a developed country. In other settings maternal stress levels can be substantially higher and more variable, potentially leading to different results than in our study. Lastly, including analyses on functional profiling of the gut microbiota was beyond the scope of this study, but is a logical next step in this area of research.


### Conclusion

Our study provides evidence that maternal prenatal and postnatal stress is related to both the maternal and the infant microbiota. Collectively, our and previous studies indicate that, apart from a positive association with microbiota volatility in infants, maternal perinatal stress is not uniformly associated with most microbiota features and that the associations are highly time point specific (i.e. sensitive to when both the stress and the microbiota assessments are made). The consistent findings on volatility warrant future research investigating these associations further and in more depth.
