A growing body of research indicates that an allostatic overload caused by acute or chronic stress during pregnancy and postpartum can raise the risk of short and long term adverse (mental) health outcomes for the mother and her child [@vandenberghPrenatalDevelopmentalOrigins2020;@beydounPhysicalMentalHealth2008;@bussieresMaternalPrenatalStress2015;@graignic-philippeEffectsPrenatalStress2014;@egmoseLongtermEffectsMaternal2022;@walkerLongTermImpactMaternal2020;@hsuMaternalLifeStress2018]. Animal studies showed that the gut microbiota may be a potential mediator and moderator for the effects of stress [@baileyPrenatalStressAlters2004;@golubevaPrenatalStressinducedAlterations2015;@jasarevicNovelRoleMaternal2015;@jasarevicStressPregnancyAlters2017;@depalmaMicrobiotaHostDeterminants2015;@desbonnetEffectsProbioticBifidobacterium2010;@omahonyEarlyLifeStress2009] via various pathways [@cryanMicrobiotaGutBrainAxis2019;@kimmelMaternalMicrobiomeMap2023]. However, human studies investigating these associations remain scarce and limited. In this study, we explore the associations between pre- and postnatal maternal stress and features of the human maternal and infant gut microbiota during and after pregnancy.


The gut microbiota can influence host-health for instance via the gut brain axis [@cryanMicrobiotaGutBrainAxis2019]. The maternal microbiota plays a special role. Prenatally, it informs the fetus [@kaisanlahtiMaternalMicrobiotaCommunicates2023] and programs the functioning of the fetal intestine [@hussoImpactsMaternalMicrobiota2023]. Postnatally, it is the most important source of microbes for the initial colonization of the infant gut by microbes through vertical transmission [@browneMotherInfantTransmission2022;@valles-colomerVariationTransmissionHuman2022;@valles-colomerPersontopersonTransmissionLandscape2023;@vandaeleMicrobialTransmissionMother2019;@wangMaternalVerticalTransmission2020]. Accordingly, variables that affect the maternal microbiota, such as prenatal stress, may also directly or indirectly affect the health of the offspring [@kimmelMaternalMicrobiomeMap2023] and should be explored and defined. In the following, we briefly summarize the status of the literature on maternal microbiota studies in relation to pregnancy and then maternal and infant microbiota studies in relation to prenatal and postnatal stress.

Previous literature indicates that the maternal gut microbiota does not undergo significant changes during pregnancy [@digiulioTemporalSpatialVariation2015a;@yangSystematicAnalysisGut2020], although one study reported drastic changes [@korenHostRemodelingGut2012]. A recent study suggests that changes may depend on host factors such as pre-pregnancy BMI (pBMI) and parity [@kennedyParityModulatesImpact2022]; more specifically, the gut microbiota would change more in primiparous women with low pBMI, and less in multiparous women or women who have a high pBMI. Altogether, these studies leave remaining uncertainty as to whether the maternal gut microbiota changes because of pregnancy, whether it returns to its pre-pregnancy state afterwards and whether this depends on host characteristics. Addressing this uncertainty may help shed light for understanding the short- and long-term implications of pregnancy for maternal health.

Although a link between stress and the gut microbiota has been established in non-pregnant individuals [@leighImpactAcuteChronic2023], prenatal stress has barely been explored as a factor that may potentially influence the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy. To our knowledge, there are only two previous human studies that investigated associations between prenatal stress and the maternal gut microbiota during pregnancy [@hechlerAssociationPsychosocialStress2019;@naudeAssociationMaternalPrenatal2020]. These studies were limited to one stool sample per mother in late pregnancy. Furthermore, they had relatively low sample sizes (N = 70; N = 84) and a limited taxonomic resolution at genus level (based on 16S rRNA sequencing), as well as measures of stress exclusively based on self-report. Nonetheless, these studies found that fecal specimens from mothers exposed to intimate partner violence had higher proportions of the family Lactobacillaceae and lower proportions of Peptostreptococcaceae at birth [@naudeAssociationMaternalPrenatal2020] and that maternal general anxiety (State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory; STAI [@spielberger1989state]) was related to overall microbiota composition, mainly driven by differences in *Parasutterella*, *Staphylococcus*, *Rothia*, *Oxalobacter* and several bacteria belonging to the class of Clostridia [@hechlerAssociationPsychosocialStress2019]. 



More studies examined the associations between maternal prenatal stress and the infant gut microbiota [@zijlmansMaternalPrenatalStress2015;@mephamExploringEffectPrenatal2023;@duttonMaternalPsychosocialStress2023;@galleyMaternalAnxietyDepression2023;@weissMaternalStressThird2023]. Collectively, they identified associations between prenatal stress and infant microbiota features including alpha- and beta diversity, as well as relative abundances of individual genera. Besides several unique findings, five out of 10 studies found a positive association between prenatal stress and Proteobacteria (one study found the opposite; reviewed in @mephamExploringEffectPrenatal2023). Also, four out of 10 studies found a negative association with *Bifidobacterium* [@duttonMaternalPsychosocialStress2023;@zijlmansMaternalPrenatalStress2015;@galleyMaternalAnxietyDepression2023;@jahnkeMaternalPrecarityHPA2021], while one found the opposite [@weissMaternalStressThird2023]. Studies found both positive [@duttonMaternalPsychosocialStress2023;@rojasLongtermTrimesterspecificEffects2023;@zijlmansMaternalPrenatalStress2015] and negative [@galleyMaternalAnxietyDepression2023;@jahnkeMaternalPrecarityHPA2021] associations with alpha diversity. Prenatal stress was defined heterogeneously between studies and time points of stress measurement and stool sampling varied considerably, although most studies included an infant stool sample taken at around two to three months of age. These differences impede reproducibility of findings. Moreover, @rojasLongtermTrimesterspecificEffects2023 and @vandenberghPrenatalDevelopmentalOrigins2020 report measurement- and trimester-specific associations between prenatal stress and the infant gut microbiota and other outcome measures, respectively. This implies that reproducibility of findings may have been further hampered by the possibility that the effects of prenatal stress may be trimester specific. Lastly, most of these studies (nine out of 10) were limited to a taxonomic resolution at the genus level (due to the use of 16S rRNA sequencing) and only two out of 10 studies collected more than one infant stool sample [@duttonMaternalPsychosocialStress2023;@zijlmansMaternalPrenatalStress2015]. 



In sum, there is a lack of studies focusing on the association between prenatal stress and the maternal microbiota during pregnancy. Across mother and infant microbiota studies, differences between studies related to the stress measurements utilized and the time points of stress and microbiota sampling necessitate a larger number of studies and standardization of research methodology to disentangle the association between prenatal stress and the maternal and infant gut microbiota. Moreover, studies are yet to investigate the magnitude of intra-individual shifts, referred to as microbiota volatility [@bastiaanssenVolatilityConceptUnderstand2021], even if repeated stool sampling was performed. Microbiota volatility has recently been positively linked to stress [@bastiaanssenVolatilityConceptUnderstand2021]. While it remains unclear whether stress causes a more volatile microbiota or vice versa, a recently published randomized controlled trial found that a de-stressing intervention reduced microbiota volatility in infants [@eckermannDailySkintoskinContact2024]. More research is needed to determine whether volatility is a biomarker of stress, which factors influence it and how it relates to other health outcome measures. The present study on healthy low-risk mothers and their infants used shotgun metagenomic sequencing to analyze three stool samples of the mother, at 18 and 32 weeks of gestation and at eight months postpartum, and four infant stool samples in the first eight months of life. Maternal stress was measured at all these time points using different self-report questionnaires. Additionally, maternal stress was objectively assessed by means of two hair cortisol samples reflecting chronic stress pre- and postnatally. 



Our data allow an in-depth exploration of the associations between pre- and postnatal stress and the maternal and infant gut microbiota by addressing the following research questions: 1) Can we observe changes in the microbiota from the second to the third trimester of pregnancy and does the microbiota at eight months postpartum differ from the microbiota during pregnancy? 2) How is maternal prenatal and postnatal stress related to the maternal gut microbiota during and after pregnancy? We explore how our results compare to previously published findings by investigating alpha diversity, beta diversity and phylum and species level abundances. We furthermore hypothesize that prenatal stress is positively related to maternal gut microbiota volatility based on previous findings [@bastiaanssenVolatilityConceptUnderstand2021;@eckermannDailySkintoskinContact2024]. 3) Does maternal pre- and postnatal stress associate with the infant gut microbiota development? Our results will add to the existing evidence and help to disentangle the association between prenatal stress and infant gut microbiota development. We hypothesize that prenatal maternal stress will be positively related to Proteobacteria and negatively related to Lactobacilli and Actinobacteria, specifically *Bifidobacterium* based on previous research. Furthermore, we hypothesize that infants of mothers who experience more stress pre- and postnatally have a more volatile gut microbiota.
