# Supplemenraty Methods



## Microbial DNA extraction

DNA was extracted from feces using the ZymoBIOMICS DNA 96 Magbead kit (ZY-D4302, Zymo Research) and an automated extraction robot, the Kingfisher Flex Purification System. DNA concentration was assessed using a fluorometer (Infinite F200, Tecan) with the Quant-iT™ dsDNA Broad-Range Assay Kit (VXQ33130, Invitrogen). A liquid handler (Biomek i7 Automated Workstation) was used to perform the in-house optimized Nextera XT Library preparation (FC-131-1096, Illumina). In summary, 0.25 ng of genomic DNA was used as a template for the library preparation. A tagmentation step was carried out at 55 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes using a transposome to add Illumina adapters, creating fragments of approximately 300 bp. The tagmented DNA with the Illumina adapter was then employed as a template for PCR amplification and to add unique index primers. The PCR protocol included 72°C for 3 minutes, 95°C for 30 seconds and 12 cycles ofthe following: 95°C for 10 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 5 minutes and hold at 10°C.
 
The PCR products were purified using Agencourt© AMPure® XP (A63882 Becker Coulter). DNA was measured using the fluorometer ( Infinite F200 Pro Tecan) and fluorometric analysis (Quant-iT™ dsDNA High Sensitivity, Invitrogen). The purified PCR products were equimolarly pooled, followed by sequencing on the Novaseq 6000 (Illumina) for a minimum of 1500 Mb per sample. FASTQ read sequence files were generated using bcl2fastq version 2.20 (Illumina). Initial quality assessment was based on data passing the Illumina Chastity filtering. Subsequently, reads containing PhiX control signal were removed using by aligning to the PhiX reference sequence (Bowtie2.2.6) and taking the unaligned reads. In addition, reads containing (partial) adapters were clipped (up to a minimum read length of 50bp) by using fastq-mcf from the ea-utils package v1.04.807. The second quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.11.8. 

## Microbial taxonomic profiling

MetaPhlAn [@truongMetaPhlAn2EnhancedMetagenomic2015] v4.0 was used to conduct taxonomic profiling of the metagenomic samples. This tool uses a library of clade-specific markers to provide quantification at species level for microbial entities, including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotes. The default settings were applied when running MetaPhlAn. HUMAnN3 [@abubuckerMetabolicReconstructionMetagenomic2012] v3.0 was used to perform functional profiling. When provided with an input metagenome, HUMAnN3 generates a sample-specific reference database, which is constructed by concatenating and indexing the pangenomes of species identified by  MetaPhlAn in the sample. Pangenomes refer to pre-clustered and pre-annotated catalogues of open reading frames that are found across isolated genomes from a particular species [@huangMetaRefPangenomicDatabase2014]. Subsequently, using HUMAnN3, sample reads were mapped against this database to quantify the presence and abundance of genes in a species-stratified manner. Unmapped reads were further used in a translated search against UniRef90 [@suzekUniRefClustersComprehensive2015] to include abundances of gene families that are taxonomically unclassified but functionally distinct. Lastly, HUMAnN3 reconstructed metabolic pathway abundance, to determine community-total, species-stratified, and unclassified gene family abundance. This reconstruction was based on the subset of gene families annotated to metabolic reactions, based on reaction and pathway definitions from MetaCyc [@caspiMetaCycDatabaseMetabolic2016]. Enzyme abundances at the level-4 Enzyme Commission (EC) categories were further computed by summing the abundances of individual gene families annotated to each EC number. The annotations were based on UniRef90-EC annotations obtained from UniProt [@theuniprotconsortiumUniProtUniversalProtein2023]. A phylogenetic tree was obtained using the chocophlan database *mpa_vJan21_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202103* (obtained from https://github.com/biobakery/MetaPhlAn/blob/master/metaphlan/utils/mpa_vJan21_CHOCOPhlAnSGB_202103.nwk).
